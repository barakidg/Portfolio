    bio: "Full-stack developer with a passion for clean code and stable architectures. Designing, Developing and Sustaining Web Applications.",
    backstory: `After a brief introduction to coding in high school,
                I realized that building digital tools was exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
                So when I got into Addis Ababa University,
                I joined computer science.
                I’m currently in my third year, and
                every night from 6 PM to 11 PM is strictly dedicated to building and breaking things.
                While I handle my academic load during the day, the nights are for mastering the stack.
                I’ve built a solid foundation in Full- stack development and
                I’m currently expanding my reach into Python and PHP to better understand different backend architectures.`,
    philosophy: "Do what you love, love what you do.",
